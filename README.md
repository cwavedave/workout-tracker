# workout-tracker
Project using natural language queries from Nutritionix and updating google sheets via API using Sheety

The project allows users to document their workouts by writing in a natural way which is then converted into column and row data. Nutritonix's backend will then automatically convert the information into seperate workouts if applicable & convert units into actionable data based on user information stored. IE based on users physical attributes, will make a guess of number of calories burned / duration of run if only basic information is given such as "ran 20 miles"
