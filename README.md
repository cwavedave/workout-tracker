# workout-tracker
Project using natural language queries from Nutritionix and updating google sheets via API using Sheety

The project allows users to document their workouts by writing in a natural way which is then converted into column and row data. Nutritonix's backend will then automatically convert the information into seperate workouts if applicable & convert units into actionable data based on user information stored. IE based on users physical attributes, will make a guess of number of calories burned / duration of run if only basic information is given such as "ran 20 miles", it will take that information and workout based on averages for that age group and physical attributes the duration as being for example - ran for 200 minutes and burnt 2352 calories, while this is obviously at the higher end of the guesstimates, it makes for an interesting learning project.
